## Publications and Forthcoming Papers
1. [What Effect Did Medicare Part D Have on SSDI Medicare Beneficiaries? A Look at Prescription Drug Coverage, Utilization, and Expenditures](https://doi.org/10.1086/724795)         
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>   
   Medicare Part D expanded public prescription drug insurance coverage to millions of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) Medicare beneficiaries. Using difference-indifferences estimation and data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, I estimate the effect of Medicare Part D on the prescription drug coverage, utilization, and expenditures of this understudied group. I estimate that the policy increased prescription drug coverage by 18 percentage points and decreased annual out-of-pocket prescription drug expenditure by $526 (a decrease of 42 percent from the pre-reform mean). Additionally, the estimates suggest modest substitution away from private prescription drug coverage (decrease of 5.7 percentage points) and little decrease in annual private insurance prescription drug expenditure ($31). This would suggest large welfare gains from the policy for the Part D eligible SSDI population.

## Works in Progress
1. [How Did the Affordable Care Act Affect SSDI Beneficiaries Waiting for Medicare? A Look at Health Insurance Coverage, Medical Care Spending, and Medical Care Utilization]  
   #This version: May 2023  
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   The introduction of the Affordable Care Act ushered in significant changes to the U.S. health insurance landscape. One group that stood to benefit was Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries. SSDI beneficiaries can receive Medicare coverage, but they must wait two years after SSDI entitlement before coverage begins. During the two-year waiting period, SSDI beneficiaries must get health insurance from other sources.  An open question is whether SSDI beneficiaries have adequate options during the waiting period. With the health insurance expansions brought on by the Affordable Care Act, SSDI beneficiaries in the waiting period may have experienced increased health insurance access. In this study, I use difference-in-difference-in-differences estimation and data from the American Community Survey and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to understand the effects of the Affordable Care Act on this group. I expect individuals experienced increases in health insurance coverage, medical care utilization, and medical care spending. Preliminary descriptive evidence suggests large gains in health insurance coverage from both the Medicaid expansions and the individual market reforms.</p>

2. [Evaluating the Heterogeneous Effects and Drug Price Effects of Medicare Part D on SSDI Medicare Beneficiaries] 
   #This version: April 2023  
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   I investigate additional effects of the the Medicare Part D expansion on Medicare-eligible SSDI beneficiaries. I look more closely at effects on specific kinds of drugs, such as insulin, antidepressants, and cancer medications. Additionally, I look at the heterogeneous effects of the policy across this group based on the observables in the MEPS data. Lastly, I investigate the changes to prices of prescription drugs used by these individuals.</p>
