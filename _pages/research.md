## Publications and Forthcoming Papers
1. [What Effect Did Medicare Part D Have on SSDI Medicare Beneficiaries? A Look at Prescription Drug Coverage, Utilization, and Expenditures](https://doi.org/10.1086/724795) (Forthcoming, *American Journal of Health Economics*)
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>   
   Medicare Part D expanded public prescription drug insurance coverage to millions of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) Medicare beneficiaries. Using difference-indifferences estimation and data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, I estimate the effect of Medicare Part D on the prescription drug coverage, utilization, and expenditures of this understudied group. I estimate that the policy increased prescription drug coverage by 18 percentage points and decreased annual out-of-pocket prescription drug expenditure by \$526 (a decrease of 42 percent from the pre-reform mean). Additionally, the estimates suggest modest substitution away from private prescription drug coverage (decrease of 5.7 percentage points) and little decrease in annual private insurance prescription drug expenditure (\$31). This would suggest large welfare gains from the policy for the Part D eligible SSDI population.

## Works in Progress
1. How Did the Affordable Care Act Affect Social Security Disability Insurance Beneficiaries Waiting for Medicare? A Look at Changes in Health Insurance Coverage (**Job Market Paper**)  
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   The Affordable Care Act ushered in significant changes to the U.S. health insurance landscape. One group that stood to benefit was Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries. SSDI beneficiaries receive Medicare coverage after a two-year waiting period.  An open question is whether SSDI beneficiaries have adequate options during the waiting period. With the health insurance expansions brought on by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), SSDI beneficiaries in the waiting period may have experienced increased health insurance access. In this study, I use difference-in-difference-in-differences estimation and data from the American Community Survey to estimate the effects of the ACA on this group. For SSDI beneficiaries in the waiting period, I estimate that the policy increased health insurance coverage by 8.3 percentage points. In Medicaid expansion states, coverage increased 12.0 percentage points, and in non-expansion states, coverage increased 3.5 percentage points. The large health insurance gains suggest that the ACA improved health insurance access during the Medicare waiting period.

2. Evaluating the Heterogeneous Effects and Drug Price Effects of Medicare Part D on SSDI Medicare Beneficiaries
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   I investigate additional effects of the Medicare Part D expansion on Medicare-eligible SSDI beneficiaries. I look more closely at effects on specific kinds of drugs, such as insulin, antidepressants, and cancer medications. Additionally, I look at the heterogeneous effects of the policy across this group based on the observables in the MEPS data. Lastly, I investigate the changes to prices of prescription drugs used by these individuals.
