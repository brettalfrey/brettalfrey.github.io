**Welcome to my website!**

I am a PhD candidate in economics at Georgia State University.  I will be on the 2023-2024 economics job market.

My research interests include health economics, public finance, and applied microeconomics.  I study the impact of public health insurance programs on health insurance access, health care utilization, and health care spending.
